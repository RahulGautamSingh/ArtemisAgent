/**
 * Provides easy reading and writing of bits in a bit field. The bytes are little-endian, so in the
 * event that the final byte is not completely utilized, it will be the most significant bits that
 * are left unused. The bits in a bit field are commonly represented as enums in IAN, but [BitField]
 * does not require this.
 *
 * Note that Artemis will never fully utilize the entire bit field. If the number of bits actually
 * used is divisible by eight, Artemis will add another (unused) byte to the end of the field. So a
 * field with eight bits will be two bytes wide instead of one like you would expect, and the second
 * byte will always be `0x00`.

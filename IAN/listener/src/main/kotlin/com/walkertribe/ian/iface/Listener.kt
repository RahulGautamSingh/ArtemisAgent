/**
 * Annotation that marks methods which are to be invoked when certain events
 * occur. To be eligible to be a Listener, a method must: 1) be public, 2) have
 * a void return type, and 3) have exactly one argument of an accepted type (or
 * any of their subtypes). The accepted types are:
 *  * [Packet][com.walkertribe.ian.protocol.Packet]
 *  * [ArtemisObject][com.walkertribe.ian.world.ArtemisObject]
 *  * [ConnectionEvent][com.walkertribe.ian.iface.ConnectionEvent]
 *
 * Annotating the method alone is not enough to get notifications; you must
 * register the object that has the annotated method with the
 * ArtemisNetworkInterface implementation that will be receiving the packets or
 * events.
 *
 * The Listener annotation is inherited; classes which override a superclass's
 * listener method need not use the Listener annotation themselves, although
 * there is no harm in doing so.
